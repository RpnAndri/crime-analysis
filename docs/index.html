      <p>
        People often say poverty and unemployment are the roots of many systemic problems in the Philippines.
      </p>
      <p>
        While poverty and unemployment are often framed as economic concerns, their reach often extends beyond, sometimes even shaping the safety and security of Filipinos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Across the country, crime remains a pressing issue that affects both rural and urban areas. In truth, the Philippines stands as the 25th country with the highest criminality globally <a href="https://ocindex.net/rankings?f=rankings&view=List" target="_blank">[1]</a>. But what factors play a major part in this alarming issue? Does the prevalence of shabu, guns, and neglected children solely define our country’s crime rate <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-so-much-crime-in-the-Philippines?force_dialog=1" target="_blank">[2]</a>? Also, does every region in the country affect this “national crime rate” equally, or do some regions commit relatively more crime than others?
      </p>
      <p>
        In this study, we approach these questions by examining the regional crime puzzle, as the title implies. We aim to dissect how poverty and employment levels vary across regions, and how these socioeconomic factors may help explain crime trends. While not implying direct causation, our goal is to ultimately uncover correlations and patterns that shed light on the extent to which improving economic opportunities could influence public safety.

            Poverty and unemployment continue to define the socioeconomic landscape of the Philippines.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to official estimates, the national poverty rate declined to 15.5% in 2023, down from 18.1% in 2021, representing about 17.54 million Filipinos living below the basic needs threshold <a href="https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1229459" target="_blank">[3]</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, crime remains a critical public concern. In the 2023 Global Organized Crime Index, the Philippines ranked 25th out of 193 countries in terms of criminality, indicating relatively high exposure to organized crime risks <a href="https://www.bworldonline.com/infographics/2023/09/28/548203/philippines-25th-globally-in-organized-crime-list/" target="_blank">[4]</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, crime is not distributed uniformly across the archipelago. Recent regional-level studies of index crimes (such as theft, assault, property crimes) have shown that incidence and types of crime differ significantly across administrative regions, especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04572" target="_blank">[5]</a>.  
          </p>
          <p>
            These observations point to pivotal questions: Why do some regions experience more crime despite similar economic conditions? How well do poverty and employment explain these spatial differences? By focusing on regional-level analysis from 2018 to 2023 (with 2025 for validation), this study aims to clarify how variations in socioeconomic status align with crime outcomes and whether improving economic conditions could help foster safer communities.

        <div class="subsection-content">
          <p class="highlighted">
            Employment and poverty are often solely used to evaluate the economic state of the country but in reality, they are deeply tied to the crimes that happen across different regions in the Philippines. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Without a clear grasp of how employment and poverty affect crime, we risk overlooking crucial factors that may aid in resolving the age-old issue of crime in the country.

          <p>
            We leverage the power of data science and machine learning to analyze statistics surrounding employment, poverty, and crimes.

            By dissecting annual and regional data from 2018 to the most recent available data, we hope to surface correlations that can spark deeper conversations about crime and its root causes that facilitate the lived realities of Filipinos today.

            Regional poverty statistics was sourced from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) database, encompassing quarterly data from years 2018, 2021, and 2023. Among 432 regional samples (18 regions per specific poverty field category and 24 collated tables, hence, 18 * 24 = 432 regional samples), we utilized only Table 5a and Table 6a of the dataset (totalling 18 * 3 = 54 regional samples) since they focus on the income-based magnitude of poor individuals residing in urban and rural areas, respectively. Intuitively, poor individuals from urban and rural areas collectively account for the total number of poor individuals from the regions considered. Likewise, income is said to be the primary basis for poverty, which is why this is the relevant table for the study.
            <br><br>
            Note: Data for regional poverty statistics is only collected quarterly which explains the gaps between the years considered. This explains why the study will consider three (3) methods to interpret the data: 
            <br><br>&emsp; 1. <span class="dataset-bold">Direct Analysis (Sparse Years)</span> - Correlation and regression analysis using only the available years (2018, 2021, 2023).

            <br>&emsp; 3. <span class="dataset-bold">Imputation & Time Series Modeling</span> - Estimating values for gap years (2019, 2020, 2022) using statistical interpolation and time series forecasting techniques.

These were all taken from Chapter 17: Public Order, Safety, and Justice, but differed in terms of year of publication. The 2018 data were from Table 3 of the 2019 yearbook. The 2020 and 2021 data were from Table 3 of the 2021 yearbook. Lastly, the 2022 and 2023 data were from the 2024 yearbook. The total number of <span class="dataset-bold">index</span> and <span class="dataset-bold">non-index crimes</span> was tracked. Index crimes are categorized as serious crimes such as homicide, robbery, physical injury, and rape. On the other hand, non-index crimes cover less extreme cases, such as illegal logging, illegal possession of firearms and drugs, and other local ordinances.  Adding these properties will give the total number of crimes in that region. Furthermore, the <span class="dataset-bold">cleared cases</span>, meaning a charge has been placed against an individual, for these types of crimes, were also included in the dataset. Lastly, the <span class="dataset-bold">total number of solved crimes,</span> the cases where the criminal is taken into custody, is also included to better measure the efficiency of law enforcement in each region. Unfortunately, the 2019 dataset for crime was not found in any publicly available database. The 2025 dataset was retrieved from foi.gov.ph in response to a successful public request in a form of a scanned document. The data was manually encoded in the unified data sheet below.</p>

            <p>
              Upon inspecting and understanding the unified dataset initially, we observed that its shape it has 119 rows and 24 columns, giving it a shape of <span class="code-text">(119, 24)</span>. From this, we noticed that the dataset is small-scale. Apart from its size, we also noticed that some columns need to be converted to a numerical value to be compatible with our study’s successive statistical tests. As such, we convert these columns (i.e., <span class="code-text">population_estimate_15_over</span>,
    <span class="code-text">labor_force_estimate</span>,
    <span class="code-text">poverty_rural</span>,
    <span class="code-text">index_crime</span>,
    <span class="code-text">index_crime_clear</span>,
    <span class="code-text">nonindex_crime</span>,
    <span class="code-text">nonindex_crime_clear</span>,
    <span class="code-text">crime_sovled_total</span>
) to a numerical value (either float or integer but in our case, we converted it to a float).

              After data conversion to numerical values, some columns are irrelevant to the study’s aim. As such, said columns were dropped which cut the dataset’s shape to <span class="code-text">(119, 10)</span>. Apart from this, column(s) were renamed just for uniform’s sake (i.e., <span class="code-text">crime_sovled_total</span> to <span class="code-text">total_crime_solved</span> since we were getting annoyed with the spelling haha…)

              From the unified dataset, we noted that some were not correctly up to scale, such as <span class="code-text">population_estimate_over</span>, <span class="code-text">poverty_urban</span>, and <span class="code-text">poverty_rural</span>. In truth, their values were divided by <em>1000</em> from the dataset, which inclined us to multiply their values by <em>1000</em> to affix them to their true values.

            <p>
Normally, this is done after outlier detection but since outliers may opt us to do this again… it was a tactical option to do this before outlier testing so that data cleaning (if needed) would likewise be only done once. 

Primarily, we engineered and added features such as <span class="code-text">total_poverty</span> to further test our hypotheses and help in answering the research questions. More so, we ensured the inclusion of poverty and crime RATES to account for differences in regional populations. After all, larger populations may intuitively correspond to higher poverty, crime, and employment figures. Thus, we’re gonna be evaluating the effect of RAW COUNTS and RATES to crime on both scales! This then boomed our dataset’s shape from <span class="code-text">(119, 10)</span> to <span class="code-text">(119, 18)</span>.

            <p>
              Proceeding with outlier testing, we ensured to avoid hastiness by merely picking some outlier testing and running our dataset on it. As such, we first ran normality testing using the Shapiro-Wilk test to check if our dataset was normally distributed. If it were, we ran a Z-score test. Otherwise, we ran an IQR test. 

From this, we noticed that the only "<em>Likely Normal</em>" feature in our dataset was <span class="code-text">total_poverty</span>. As such, we ran every feature on IQR, whilst running only <span class="code-text">total_poverty</span> on Z-score. From this, we got similar results, showing only one (1) critical outlier - an inconsistency to <span class="code-text">total_poverty_rate</span> which amounted to 109%…. which is ABSURD! This suggested a data inconsistency in the original dataset. As such, this calls for a fix… which we carried out through data imputation!

To do so, we carried out data standardization using <span class="code-text">RobustScaler()</span> because our data was not normally distributed.

            With the data preprocessed and ready, we can now analyze the data to uncover patterns and insights regarding the relationship between poverty, employment, and crime rates across Philippine regions. For now, let's answer our research questions!

            <br><p>Before explaining the answers to the research questions. Do note that we tried 4 different approaches to determine and look for possible trends and correlations to properly answer the research questions. Direct Analysis, Tolerance of Gaps, Imputation and Time Series Forecasting, and Imputation + Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were and analyzed. Each approach gave insights on the available data, and the last method, Imputation + PCA, served to be the most insightful for the answers. Learn more about the approaches done in the github repository.</p><br>
            
            <div class="subsubsection-title">1.) What is the correlation between poverty and employment with crime rates across regions in the Philippines?</div>
            <p>
              Scatter plots were done to visualize the relationships of poverty and employment with crime. We compared urban poverty-total crime, rural poverty-total crime, and employment rate-total crime. 
            </p>
            <div class="container">

            </div>
            <p>
              Using these data plots, there is no obvious pattern or trend among the collection of points. Urban-Crime seems to show a slowly rising trend with the more urban population having more crimes committed. The Rural-Crime graph shows a bit of random points, and the same goes for the Employment-Crime graph. A deeper analysis must be done in order to determine the underlying trends that is not so clear to the naked eye. A correlation heatmap graph is done to visualize the and numericize the correlations.
            </p>
            <div class="corr2">

            </div>
            <p>
              Analyzing this correlation heatmap, it seems that urban poverty has the greatest correlation among the other variables with respect to the total crimes committed in a region. Then, employment rate takes the second indicator, tho note that it shows a negative correlation, and finally rural poverty which shows a very close to 0 correlation.
              There could be many reasons for this, such as a more "relaxed" life in rural areas or provinces and other cultural reasons. For now, we will keep it as is. This is not a worry as this observed relationship and reasoning will be further discussed in the findings.
              This correlation heatmap graph, directly answers research question number 1. Now let us look at a more "regional" perspective and point of view.

            <div class="subsubsection-title">2.) How do regional variations in these socioeconomic and institutional factors (i.e., poverty and employment) influence differences in crime rates?</div>
            <p>
              Here, we would like to analyze the regional variations or in other words, compare the values in each region. We would mainly use the Imputation and Time Series Forecasting approach for this research question.
              First, we will show the time series plots and compare the regions.

              From these graphs, we can see the regions generally follow the same trends. 
              Urban poverty rose from 2018 to 2021 possibly due to the pandemic, and some regions started to recover after the peak in 2021 and declined back through 2022 to 2025.
              Employment rate also took a huge drop in 2020 possibly due to the pandemic, but it rose back the following year in 2021 and continued to rise or remain stagnant until 2025.'
              The total crime per region all have a declining trend from 2018 to 2025. 
              There does not seem to be much of an outlier except for NCR, which was affirmed in the IQR test in the EDA, approximately having 140,000 total number of crimes during 2018. <!-- NOTE that outliers affirmed due to the IQR test and z-score test/standardization done in EDA? -->
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking at the urban poverty of the regions, and comparing their total number of crimes, we can see a slight correlation or pattern concerning the region.
              Specifically observing the top 5 regions in the urban poverty category namely, region 4A, region 3, region 7, region 10, and 12, all of them except region 10 and 12 are also found in the top 5 number of total crimes committed, but with a slight difference in order.
              NCR has the most, followed by region 4A, region 7, region 3, and lastly region 11. As explained earlier, there is a slight correlation amongst the number of urban poverty and total number of crime, and this holds true for the top 5 regions.

              Moving on to employment, all the regions are not differing that much to each other. Taking the bottom 5 regions in employment rate, we get NCR, region 4A, region 1, region 3, and region 5. 
              Out of the 5 regions, only 3 of them are in the top 5 of the total number of crimes, and only 2 are also part of the top 5 in urban poverty. 
              
              Now looking at the opposite side and checking the bottom 5 regions in the urban poverty categroy, we get regions CAR, 6, 2, 1, and 8.
              Now for the employment rate (highest), we get regions, 2, 9, 11, 13, 12, and for total crime (lowest), we get BARMM, CAR, region 4B, 13, 9.
              From here we can see that CAR (poverty), and region 9 and 13 (employment rate) are both found in the total crime. 

              Region 4B is the 6th least number of people classified under urban poverty and region 13 ranked 6th, and region 9 ranked 7th least which shows a bit of a relationship to the low crimes.
              However, BARMM, having the least number of crimes committed, actually ranks high in the urban poverty, ranking at 7th, and ranking 4th in rural poverty, and 6th lowest employment rate.
              Despite these counterintuitive placements, they rank the lowest number of crimes. This could be due to many factors such as religion and the 2014 peace deal ending the war in the region and the continuous seek to end conflicts.
            </p>

            Now, let's look at the averages throughout the years in a bar graph to compare them easier.
            <div class="graphs">
              <img src="./images/3_methodology/b_researchQuestions/avg_p.png" alt="" class="graph">

              <img src="./images/3_methodology/b_researchQuestions/avg_c.png" alt="" class="graph">
            </div>
            <p>
              Here, we can see the average crime rate seem to be higher in 3 regions, namely NCR, Region 7 (Central Visayas), and Region 11 (Davao Region). There seems to be some relation on the location of a region on the crime rate, which can be due to employment and poverty rates associated to the said locations. 
              One thing to notice about this big 3 is that they are also relatively high on the urban poverty in their respective regions which can support the correlation found in research question 1.

            This section focuses on evaluating our proposed null hypotheses through statistical hypothesis testing. We employed multiple analytical approaches to robustly assess the relationships between poverty, employment, and crime rates across Philippine regions.

            <div class="subsubsection-title">a.) An Overview</div>
            <p>
            If both the independent feature (i.e., poverty and/or employment feature) and the target are approximately normally distributed, we carry out a Pearson correlation test. Otherwise, a Spearman correlation test is conducted. This approach allows us to quickly identify linear or monotonic relationships between each feature and the target variable.
            Similarly, group comparison tests are performed to determine whether the target variable differs significantly between subgroups. For this, we first split each feature into two groups based on quantiles (Low vs. High). Then, we apply Levene’s test to check for equality of variances. If variances are equal, we use an independent t-test (parametric); if not, we use a Mann–Whitney U test (non-parametric). This approach is used because the t-test assumes equal variances and normally distributed data, while the Mann–Whitney U test is robust to unequal variances and non-normal distributions. By dynamically selecting the appropriate test, we ensure that our conclusions about differences or associations are statistically valid regardless of the underlying distribution of the data.

            <div class="subsubsection-title">b.) The Turnout</div>
            <p>
              Performing hypothesis tests to determine if poverty levels and/or employment levels have a significant effect on crime rates across Philippine regions, we took a branched granular approach. By granular, we mean that we did not only focus on raw numbers of poverty and employment to determine how they affect crime in the country as a whole. In actuality, we also considered rates of poverty and employment across regions because intuitively (without data in mind yet…), regions that are larger would seem to have a bigger scale and thus, a denser proportion in poverty, employment, and crime numbers. But does scaling regions fairly have a significant effect on crime rates or were raw counts enough to predict crime counts nationally?
            </p>

            <div class="subsubsection-indent">
              <div class="subsubsubsection-title">i.) Counts</div>
              <p>
  Throughout the four (4) approaches (note that we added Imputation + PCA to the initial 3 approaches due to statistical suggestion), it was clear that through hypothesis testing, <span class="code-text">poverty_urban</span> and <span class="code-text">employment_rate</span> reveal to be significant factors that have an effect on crime counts. With a significance level of 0.05, we effectively rejected the null hypotheses that poverty (only urban, not rural) and employment have no significant effect on crime counts across Philippine regions. This revelation is consistent across hypothesis testing through four (4) approaches and thus, we’ll interpret this as a robust and accurate conclusion!

              <div class="subsubsubsection-title">ii.) Rates</div>
              <p>
  Contrary to counts, we determined from the four (4) approaches that rates aren’t accurately predicted by the socioeconomic factors due to perhaps a lack in data or some other tangible. So before hypothesis testing, it was etched in our minds that similar to the run approaches, hypothesis testing would reveal some inconsistencies. Unsurprisingly, this expectation was explicitly reveal in our hypothesis testing.
  After running hypothesis tests focused on rates, we showed that only employment_rate had a resounding rejection to the null hypothesis of employment having no significant effect on crime rates. However, compared to counts, this conclusion was inconsistent across the four (4) approaches because the direct analysis approach failed to reject the hypothesis. Hence, as expected, poverty and employment rates may probably have a significant effect on crime rates but with the means available to us, rates would deem to be inconclusive.

            As far as we've explored, we haven't answered all of our questions! To answer the final research question (RQ3), we will be needing predictive modeling! As per usual, please check the github for a more detailed explanation.

            <div class="subsubsection-title">3.) To what extent can improvements in these factors (e.g., reduced poverty, increased employment) predict a decrease in crime rates across regions?</div>
            <p>
              Looping back to the final research question, the machine learning model will determine if improvements in lowering poverty and increasing employment will affect the number of crimes.
              To evaluate whether socioeconomic indicators can predict crime across Philippine regions, multiple machine learning models were tested using cross-validated R<sup>2</sup> scores. Two separate targets were evaluated namely, <strong>Crime Counts</strong> and <strong>Crime Rates (per capita)</strong>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forst, and Gradient Boosting were used and validated using R<sup>2</sup>.
              Linear Regression was chosen to look for any linear relationships between the variables. Ridge and Lasso Regression were chosen to reduce multicollinearity since poverty and employment may be correlated as seen from the heatmap.
              Random Forest and Gradient Boosting were also chosen to incorporate nonlinear relationships and regional differences.

            <p>
              To further ensure accurate and the best results, some simple tuning was done to the hyperparameters as seen in the picture above. The results are seen below. Again, for the full code and implementation of the models, please visit the Github repository.

            <br>
            <p>This was also done to predict the crime rates using the same models, however, none of them showed to be effective or reliable.</p>
            <p>
              From the results and validation using R<sup>2</sup>, we can determine that Ridge and Lasso performed the best among the models with a score of 0.315 and 0.254 respectively.
              They performed the best due to ridge reducing coefficient variance and Lasso setting irrelevant coefficients to zero (feature selection).
              This applies to this study since socioeconomic indicators such as poverty and employment share an overlapping variance, and regularization prevents overfitting while keeping the meaningful predictors.
              However, it is important to note that these ML outputs do not provide feature importance for Ridge and Lasso since key predictors came from hypothesis testing and not ML coefficients.
              This means that the main drivers were determined by the hypothesis testing and these models are only used for prediction. They work hand in hand to give meaning to the data.
