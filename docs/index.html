      <p>
        People often say poverty and unemployment are the roots of many systemic problems in the Philippines.
      </p>
      <p>
        While poverty and unemployment are often framed as economic concerns, their reach often extends beyond, sometimes even shaping the safety and security of Filipinos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Across the country, crime remains a pressing issue that affects both rural and urban areas. In truth, the Philippines stands as the 25th country with the highest criminality globally <a href="https://ocindex.net/rankings?f=rankings&view=List">[1]</a>. But what factors play a major part in this alarming issue? Does the prevalence of shabu, guns, and neglected children solely define our country’s crime rate <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-so-much-crime-in-the-Philippines?force_dialog=1">[2]</a>? Also, does every region in the country affect this “national crime rate” equally, or do some regions commit relatively more crime than others?
      </p>
      <p>
        In this study, we approach these questions by examining the regional crime puzzle, as the title implies. We aim to dissect how poverty and employment levels vary across regions, and how these socioeconomic factors may help explain crime trends. While not implying direct causation, our goal is to ultimately uncover correlations and patterns that shed light on the extent to which improving economic opportunities could influence public safety.

          <li><strong>1.</strong> What is the correlation between poverty and employment with crime rates across regions in the Philippines?</li>
          <li><strong>2.</strong> How do regional variations in these socioeconomic and institutional factors (i.e., poverty and employment) influence differences in crime rates?</li>
          <li><strong>3.</strong> To what extent can improvements in these factors (e.g., reduced poverty, increased employment) predict a decrease in crime rates across regions?</li>

        <p class="dataset-card-desc">The employment data from 2018 to 2022 were also retrieved from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), specifically from Table 1, Chapter 11 of the 2024 PSA Yearbook. These include the estimated population per region, the labor force participation rate, and the employment and unemployment rates.  The 2023 data, on the other hand, was retrieved from PSA, but from their 2023 Annual Provincial Labor Market Statistics (Preliminary Results). The labor force participation, employment, and unemployment rates were taken from tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively. It is necessary to note that the population numbers pertain to people above 15 years old. Furthermore, the measurements are estimates and should be read in thousands. The given data already has its own statistical analysis, such as the coefficient of variation (COV), standard error, 95% confidence intervals, and many more. These processed data were not used in this group’s data set. Lastly, the employment data is the most complete among the datasets, with no missing years from 2018 to 2023.</p>
