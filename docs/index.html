        People often say poverty and unemployment are the roots of many systemic problems in the Philippines.
      </p>
      <p>
        While poverty and unemployment are often framed as economic concerns, their reach often extends beyond, sometimes even shaping the safety and security of Filipinos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Across the country, crime remains a pressing issue that affects both rural and urban areas. In truth, the Philippines stands as the 25th country with the highest criminality globally <a href="https://ocindex.net/rankings?f=rankings&view=List">[1]</a>. But what factors play a major part in this alarming issue? Does the prevalence of shabu, guns, and neglected children solely define our country’s crime rate <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-so-much-crime-in-the-Philippines?force_dialog=1">[2]</a>? Also, does every region in the country affect this “national crime rate” equally, or do some regions commit relatively more crime than others?
      </p>
      <p>
        In this study, we approach these questions by examining the regional crime puzzle, as the title implies. We aim to dissect how poverty and employment levels vary across regions, and how these socioeconomic factors may help explain crime trends. While not implying direct causation, our goal is to ultimately uncover correlations and patterns that shed light on the extent to which improving economic opportunities could influence public safety.

        <div class="subsection-content">
          <p class="highlighted">
            Poverty and unemployment continue to define the socioeconomic landscape of the Philippines. According to official estimates, the national poverty rate declined to 15.5% in 2023, down from 18.1% in 2021, representing about 17.54 million Filipinos living below the basic needs threshold <a href="https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1229459">[3]</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, crime remains a critical public concern. In the 2023 Global Organized Crime Index, the Philippines ranked 25th out of 193 countries in terms of criminality, indicating relatively high exposure to organized crime risks <a href="https://www.bworldonline.com/infographics/2023/09/28/548203/philippines-25th-globally-in-organized-crime-list/">[4]</a>.  
            Moreover, crime is not distributed uniformly across the archipelago. Recent regional-level studies of index crimes (such as theft, assault, property crimes) have shown that incidence and types of crime differ significantly across administrative regions, especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04572">[5]</a>.  
            These observations point to pivotal questions: Why do some regions experience more crime despite similar economic conditions? How well do poverty and employment explain these spatial differences? By focusing on regional-level analysis from 2018 to 2023 (with 2025 for validation), this study aims to clarify how variations in socioeconomic status align with crime outcomes and whether improving economic conditions could help foster safer communities.

          <p class="highlighted">
            Employment and poverty are often solely used to evaluate the economic state of the country but in reality, they are deeply tied to the crimes that happen across different regions in the Philippines. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Without a clear grasp of how employment and poverty affect crime, we risk overlooking crucial factors that may aid in resolving the age-old issue of crime in the country.

            Recognizing this issue, what do we do?
          </p>
          <p>
            We leverage the power of data science and machine learning to analyze statistics surrounding employment, poverty, and crimes.

            By dissecting annual and regional data from 2018 to the most recent available data, we hope to surface correlations that can spark deeper conversations about crime and its root causes that facilitate the lived realities of Filipinos today.

The labor force participation, employment, and unemployment rates were taken from tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively. It is necessary to note that the population numbers pertain to people above 15 years old. Furthermore, the measurements are estimates and should be read in thousands. The given data already has its own statistical analysis, such as the coefficient of variation (COV), standard error, 95% confidence intervals, and many more. These processed data were not used in this group’s data set. Lastly, the employment data is the most complete among the datasets, with no missing years from 2018 to 2023.</p>

            Regional poverty statistics was sourced from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) database, encompassing quarterly data from years 2018, 2021, and 2023. Among 432 regional samples (18 regions per specific poverty field category and 24 collated tables, hence, 18 * 24 = 432 regional samples), we utilized only Table 5a and Table 6a of the dataset (totalling 18 * 3 = 54 regional samples) since they focus on the income-based magnitude of poor individuals residing in urban and rural areas, respectively. Intuitively, poor individuals from urban and rural areas collectively account for the total number of poor individuals from the regions considered. Likewise, income is said to be the primary basis for poverty, which is why this is the relevant table for the study.
            <br><br>
            Note: Data for regional poverty statistics is only collected quarterly which explains the gaps between the years considered. This explains why the study will consider three (3) methods to interpret the data: 
            <br><br>&emsp; 1. <span class="dataset-bold">Direct Analysis (Sparse Years)</span> - Correlation and regression analysis using only the available years (2018, 2021, 2023).

            <br>&emsp; 3. <span class="dataset-bold">Imputation & Time Series Modeling</span> - Estimating values for gap years (2019, 2020, 2022) using statistical interpolation and time series forecasting techniques.

These were all taken from Chapter 17: Public Order, Safety, and Justice, but differed in terms of year of publication. The 2018 data were from Table 3 of the 2019 yearbook. The 2020 and 2021 data were from Table 3 of the 2021 yearbook. Lastly, the 2022 and 2023 data were from the 2024 yearbook. The total number of <span class="dataset-bold">index</span> and <span class="dataset-bold">non-index crimes</span> was tracked. Index crimes are categorized as serious crimes such as homicide, robbery, physical injury, and rape. On the other hand, non-index crimes cover less extreme cases, such as illegal logging, illegal possession of firearms and drugs, and other local ordinances.  Adding these properties will give the total number of crimes in that region. Furthermore, the <span class="dataset-bold">cleared cases</span>, meaning a charge has been placed against an individual, for these types of crimes, were also included in the dataset. Lastly, the <span class="dataset-bold">total number of solved crimes,</span> the cases where the criminal is taken into custody, is also included to better measure the efficiency of law enforcement in each region. Unfortunately, the 2019 dataset for crime was not found in any publicly available database. The 2025 dataset was retrieved from foi.gov.ph in response to a successful public request in a form of a scanned document. The data was manually encoded in the unified data sheet below.</p>
