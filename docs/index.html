      <p>
        People often say poverty and unemployment are the roots of many systemic problems in the Philippines.
      </p>
      <p>
        While poverty and unemployment are often framed as economic concerns, their reach often extends beyond, sometimes even shaping the safety and security of Filipinos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Across the country, crime remains a pressing issue that affects both rural and urban areas. In truth, the Philippines stands as the 25th country with the highest criminality globally <a href="https://ocindex.net/rankings?f=rankings&view=List" target="_blank">[1]</a>. But what factors play a major part in this alarming issue? Does the prevalence of shabu, guns, and neglected children solely define our country’s crime rate <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-so-much-crime-in-the-Philippines?force_dialog=1" target="_blank">[2]</a>? Also, does every region in the country affect this “national crime rate” equally, or do some regions commit relatively more crime than others?
      </p>
      <p>
        In this study, we approach these questions by examining the regional crime puzzle, as the title implies. We aim to dissect how poverty and employment levels vary across regions, and how these socioeconomic factors may help explain crime trends. While not implying direct causation, our goal is to ultimately uncover correlations and patterns that shed light on the extent to which improving economic opportunities could influence public safety.

            Poverty and unemployment continue to define the socioeconomic landscape of the Philippines.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to official estimates, the national poverty rate declined to 15.5% in 2023, down from 18.1% in 2021, representing about 17.54 million Filipinos living below the basic needs threshold <a href="https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1229459" target="_blank">[3]</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, crime remains a critical public concern. In the 2023 Global Organized Crime Index, the Philippines ranked 25th out of 193 countries in terms of criminality, indicating relatively high exposure to organized crime risks <a href="https://www.bworldonline.com/infographics/2023/09/28/548203/philippines-25th-globally-in-organized-crime-list/" target="_blank">[4]</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, crime is not distributed uniformly across the archipelago. Recent regional-level studies of index crimes (such as theft, assault, property crimes) have shown that incidence and types of crime differ significantly across administrative regions, especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04572" target="_blank">[5]</a>.  
          </p>
          <p>
            These observations point to pivotal questions: Why do some regions experience more crime despite similar economic conditions? How well do poverty and employment explain these spatial differences? By focusing on regional-level analysis from 2018 to 2023 (with 2025 for validation), this study aims to clarify how variations in socioeconomic status align with crime outcomes and whether improving economic conditions could help foster safer communities.

        <div class="subsection-content">
          <p class="highlighted">
            Employment and poverty are often solely used to evaluate the economic state of the country but in reality, they are deeply tied to the crimes that happen across different regions in the Philippines. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Without a clear grasp of how employment and poverty affect crime, we risk overlooking crucial factors that may aid in resolving the age-old issue of crime in the country.

          <p>
            We leverage the power of data science and machine learning to analyze statistics surrounding employment, poverty, and crimes.

            By dissecting annual and regional data from 2018 to the most recent available data, we hope to surface correlations that can spark deeper conversations about crime and its root causes that facilitate the lived realities of Filipinos today.

            Regional poverty statistics was sourced from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) database, encompassing quarterly data from years 2018, 2021, and 2023. Among 432 regional samples (18 regions per specific poverty field category and 24 collated tables, hence, 18 * 24 = 432 regional samples), we utilized only Table 5a and Table 6a of the dataset (totalling 18 * 3 = 54 regional samples) since they focus on the income-based magnitude of poor individuals residing in urban and rural areas, respectively. Intuitively, poor individuals from urban and rural areas collectively account for the total number of poor individuals from the regions considered. Likewise, income is said to be the primary basis for poverty, which is why this is the relevant table for the study.
            <br><br>
            Note: Data for regional poverty statistics is only collected quarterly which explains the gaps between the years considered. This explains why the study will consider three (3) methods to interpret the data: 
            <br><br>&emsp; 1. <span class="dataset-bold">Direct Analysis (Sparse Years)</span> - Correlation and regression analysis using only the available years (2018, 2021, 2023).

            <br>&emsp; 3. <span class="dataset-bold">Imputation & Time Series Modeling</span> - Estimating values for gap years (2019, 2020, 2022) using statistical interpolation and time series forecasting techniques.

These were all taken from Chapter 17: Public Order, Safety, and Justice, but differed in terms of year of publication. The 2018 data were from Table 3 of the 2019 yearbook. The 2020 and 2021 data were from Table 3 of the 2021 yearbook. Lastly, the 2022 and 2023 data were from the 2024 yearbook. The total number of <span class="dataset-bold">index</span> and <span class="dataset-bold">non-index crimes</span> was tracked. Index crimes are categorized as serious crimes such as homicide, robbery, physical injury, and rape. On the other hand, non-index crimes cover less extreme cases, such as illegal logging, illegal possession of firearms and drugs, and other local ordinances.  Adding these properties will give the total number of crimes in that region. Furthermore, the <span class="dataset-bold">cleared cases</span>, meaning a charge has been placed against an individual, for these types of crimes, were also included in the dataset. Lastly, the <span class="dataset-bold">total number of solved crimes,</span> the cases where the criminal is taken into custody, is also included to better measure the efficiency of law enforcement in each region. Unfortunately, the 2019 dataset for crime was not found in any publicly available database. The 2025 dataset was retrieved from foi.gov.ph in response to a successful public request in a form of a scanned document. The data was manually encoded in the unified data sheet below.</p>

            <strong>1.) Handling Missing/Null Values</strong>
            <p>
              Before any transformation, the unified dataset (<span class="code-text">unified_df</span>) was inspected for missing or null values using 
              <span class="code-text">.info()</span>, <span class="code-text">.isnull().sum()</span>, and heatmap visualization. 
              No missing values were detected — the count and shape of the dataset remained consistent, 
              confirming data completeness.

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <strong>2.) Data Cleaning and Type Conversion</strong>
            <p>
              Numerical columns (e.g., <em>population</em>, <em>poverty rates</em>, <em>crime counts</em>) contained commas and spaces. 
              These were cleaned and converted to numeric types via string replacement and coercion 
              to ensure consistency and prevent type-related computation errors.

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <strong>3.) Dropping Redundant or Irrelevant Features</strong>
            <p>
              Columns such as <em>standard error</em> and <em>coefficient of variation (CV)</em> were dropped to reduce dimensionality and enhance analytical clarity. 
              Remaining variables reflected only core socioeconomic and crime-related indicators.

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <strong>4.) Feature Renaming and Reinforcement</strong>
            <p>
              Variables were standardized for semantic clarity 
              (e.g., <code>crime_solved_total</code> → <code>total_crime_solved</code>). 
              A refined dataset <code>reinforced_df</code> was created, keeping only the relevant indicators 
              such as demographics, employment, poverty, and crime statistics.

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <strong>5.) Outlier Detection and Treatment</strong>
            <p>
              Outliers were examined using both <strong>Z-score</strong> and <strong>IQR</strong> methods. 
              Potential anomalies were identified using ±3 standard deviations and 1.5×IQR thresholds. 
              Only evident data errors were removed, maintaining valid extremes for accuracy.

          </div>

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <strong>6.) Feature Engineering</strong>
            <p>
              Two composite indicators were derived:
              <code>Total Crime = Index Crime + Non-Index Crime</code> and 
              <code>Total Poverty = Poverty (Urban) + Poverty (Rural)</code>. 
              These provided more holistic regional indicators for the study.

            <strong>7.) Standardization</strong>
            <p>
              For correlation and regression analyses, numeric variables were standardized using 
              <code>StandardScaler</code> from <code>sklearn</code> 
              to achieve zero-mean and unit-variance scaling. 
              This ensured equitable influence among features of differing magnitudes.

            <strong>8.) Final Output</strong>
            <p>
              The preprocessing produced two key datasets: 
              <code>reinforced_df</code> (cleaned and optimized) and 
              <code>standardized_df</code> (normalized for inferential analysis).

            With the data preprocessed and ready, we can now analyze the data to uncover patterns and insights regarding the relationship between poverty, employment, and crime rates across Philippine regions. For now, let's answer our research questions! For a more detailed explanation, proceed to our <a href="https://github.com/RpnAndri/crime-analysis.git" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>!

            <strong>1.) What is the correlation between poverty and employment with crime rates across regions in the Philippines?</strong>
            <p>
              Scatter plots were done to visualize the relationships of poverty and employment with crime.

            <p>
              Using these data, we can see that there is little correlation between our variables, however, separating the poverty values to urban and rural, we see something different in our correlation map.
            </p>
            <div class="corr2">
              <img src="./images/3_methodology/b_researchQuestions/corr2.png" alt="" style="width: 70%; margin-top: 20px;">
            </div>
            <p>
              Now, there is a slight correlation with poverty in urban areas with the number of crimes committed. There could be many reasons for this, such as a more "relaxed" life in rural areas or provinces and other cultural reasons. For now, we will keep it as is. This is not a worry as this observed relationship and reasoning will be further discussed in the findings.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <strong>2.) How do regional variations in these socioeconomic and institutional factors (i.e., poverty and employment) influence differences in crime rates?</strong>
            <p>
              Here, we would like to analyze the regional variations or in other words, compare the values in each region. First, we will show the time series plots and compare the regions.
            </p>
            <div class="container">

            </div>
            <p>
              From these graphs, we can see the regions generally follow the same trends. There does not seem to be much of an outlier except for NCR, approximately having 140,000 total number of crimes during 2018. <!-- NOTE that outliers affirmed due to the IQR test and z-score test/standardization done in EDA? -->
              Now, let's look at the averages throughout the years in a bar graph to compare them easier.
            </p>
            <div class="graphs">
              <img src="./images/3_methodology/b_researchQuestions/avg_p.png" alt="" class="graph">

            </div>
            <p>
              Here, we can see the average crime rate seem to be higher in 3 regions, namely NCR, Region 7 (Central Visayas), and Region 11 (Davao Region). There seems to be some relation on the location of a region on the crime rate, which may be due to employment and poverty rates associated to the said locations.

           <div class="subsubsection">
            <strong>3.) To what extent can improvements in these factors (e.g., reduced poverty, increased employment) predict a decrease in crime rates across regions?</strong>
            <p>
              This will be answered using the model.

            This section focuses on evaluating our proposed hypotheses through statistical hypothesis testing. 
            Using both <strong>Pearson correlation</strong> and <strong>independent sample t-tests</strong>, 
            we assess whether socioeconomic factors, particularly <em>poverty</em> and <em>employment rate</em>,
            exhibit significant relationships with <code>total_crime</code> across Philippine regions.

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <strong>1.) Direct Analysis</strong>
            <p>
              Using raw observed data, <code>Pearson correlation</code> results showed no statistically significant linear 
              relationships between <code>poverty_urban</code>, <code>poverty_rural</code>, or 
              <code>employment_rate</code> and <code>total_crime</code>. 
              However, <code>t-tests</code> comparing regions grouped by low vs high values revealed otherwise:
              regions with <strong>higher urban poverty</strong> tend to have higher crime, while those with 
              <strong>higher employment rates</strong> tend to have lower crime. 
              This suggests that while the overall correlation may appear weak, threshold or non-linear dynamics could exist.

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <strong>2.) Tolerance of Gaps</strong>
            <p>
              Allowing small gaps (i.e., incomplete or missing entries) in the dataset did not materially alter the results.
              The <code>Pearson</code> correlations remained weak and statistically insignificant, but the 
              <code>t-test</code> results again highlighted significant contrasts between high and low groups 
              for <code>poverty_urban</code> and <code>employment_rate</code>.
              This reinforces the possibility that subtle group differences carry more explanatory power than purely linear trends.

            <!-- insert t-test summary graph here broski -->
          </div>

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <strong>3.) Imputation & Time Series</strong>
            <p>
              After addressing missing values through interpolation and time series-based imputation, 
              the correlations changed markedly. <code>Pearson</code> tests showed significant positive 
              correlation between <code>poverty_urban</code> and <code>total_crime</code> 
              (p = 0.0026), and a significant negative correlation between 
              <code>employment_rate</code> and <code>total_crime</code> (p = 0.0086). 
              <code>Poverty_rural</code> remained statistically insignificant.
            </p>
            <p>
              These results imply that missing data was <strong>masking real relationships</strong>, 
              and that urban poverty and employment are indeed meaningful predictors of crime trends when 
              the dataset is properly reinforced.

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <strong>4.) Summary of Findings</strong>
            <p>
              Comparing across all analytical approaches, only the imputation-enhanced dataset 
              revealed true linear correlations. The visual summary (heatmap) further confirms this:
              <code>poverty_urban</code> and <code>employment_rate</code> both show significance (p &lt; 0.05),
              while <code>poverty_rural</code> does not.
            </p>
            <p>
              This strengthens our argument that <strong>data completeness and cleaning</strong> 
              play a crucial role in hypothesis testing accuracy. It also establishes empirical 
              support for rejecting:
            </p>

            <ul class="hypothesis-results">
              <li><strong>H₀,₁ (Urban Poverty):</strong> Poverty has no significant effect on crime → <strong>Rejected</strong></li>
              <li><strong>H₀,₁ (Rural Poverty):</strong> Poverty has no significant effect on crime → <strong>Failed to reject</strong></li>
              <li><strong>H₀,₂:</strong> Employment rate has no significant effect on crime → <strong>Rejected</strong></li>
            </ul>
